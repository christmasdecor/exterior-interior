<p>Nonetheless I have seen many corporate bylaws that include the chairman or chair of the board in the article governing officers. All of the senior management executives report to the CEO. As discussed in Worlds In Collision Agency Law And A Directors Fiduciary Duties a director qua director is generally not an agent of the corporation and neither is the board of directors. The biggest difference is that a chairman of the board promotes shareholder interests while a CEO is essentially the head of the company itself. In the corporate hierarchy CEO is the 1 highest.

<p>But a woman holding the position can be a Chair Chairwomanor even a Chairman. All of the senior management executives report to the CEO. In light of required disclosure about board leadership structure the decision of whether or not to separate the chairman and chief executive roles remains a hot governance topic for public companies boards and shareholders. However it is common for employees and shareholders of the company to use the word chairman for the person holding this post rather than calling him chairman of the board. In simple terms the CEO is the top senior executive over management while the board chairperson is the head of the board of directors. The role is often combined with that of managing director or chief executive in smaller companies.
