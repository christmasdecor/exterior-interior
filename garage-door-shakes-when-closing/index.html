<p>The diagnosis was that the rubber trim around the door got sticky and when the door was closed for a while the trim would stick to the door. On closer inspection the trolley rail and chain begin to shake as the garage door is being lowered. One of the reasons why a garage door may shake as it is opening or closing is because there is a problem with the tracks. As your door glides over the tracks the screws holding the door in place can wiggle out loosening the tracks. If your garage door shakes when opening or closing or sounds like it is going to fall off the track the problem is most often the pulleys. We got the fitters in to check it and it turns out that there were some bits which should have been tightened at the factory but werent so the door was pulling away from the hinges.

<p>There are two types of pulleys. If your garage doors use a track system there are many issues that could cause your door to shake and rattle when they open and close. Press Fit Pulleys and Cast Iron Pulleys. Subtle changes in your garage doors operation like a vibration when it closes can be sign of an underlying mechanical issue. The garage door runs on the track system that keeps it in place during opening and closing. If theres something blocking the door from closing all the way a full close will be impossible.
