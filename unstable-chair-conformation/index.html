            <p>unstable chair conformation The chair conformation is the most stable conformation of cyclohexane. Why is chair conformation of cyclohexane more stable than boat form.</p>
<!--html tag code -->
<p><strong>Unstable Chair Conformation</strong>, Thus 3 and 5 are both equally stable and they are the most stable conformations for 2-methylbutane. In both conformations chair and boat the bond angle is 1095 which eliminates the angular strain in the cyclohexane structure. The answer is because of the torsional and steric strains which are more present in a boat conformation.</p>

<p>So the equatorial conformation is more stable than the axial by 728 kJmol. For this class we will always find that the most stable conformation is staggered ie 1 3 or 5 and the least stable is eclipsed ie 2 4 or 6. So the stability increases from Half chair to boat to twist boat and finally the chair conformation. And now the stabilities. A second much less stable conformer is the boat conformation.</p>

<p>Firstly Newman projections along either of the horizontal C-C bonds in the boat form show eclipsing and secondly the two hydrogens shown the socalled bowsprit hydrogens come within such a short distance of one another that a repulsive force. The chair conformation is the most stable conformation of cyclohexane. The different conformations are called conformers a blend of the words conformation and isomer. The chair conformation is more stable because it does not have any steric hindrance or steric repulsion between the hydrogen bonds. And using the ratio 955 it is calculated that this corresponds to 728 kJmol. This energy difference is known as the A value and it varies depending on the axial group.

<p>The equatorial bonds e are perpendicular to the axis of the ring while axial bonds a are parallel to the axis of the ring. Cyclohexane and the natural bond angles of C C and C H add a great deal of flexibility to the ring. Stability of conformation decided by many factors like angle strain- any deviation from normal bond angles. The larger the group the higher the energy difference. Besides boat conformation tends to convert into the boat-twist conformation. Number the ring and draw any chair conformation of the compound. Cyclohexane Conformational Analysis.</p>

<p>Torsional strain- a pair of tetrahedral carbons attached to each other have their bond staggered. The process of ring flipping takes cyclohexane through a conformation called the twist chair or the half chair form and this form is 108kcal less stable than the chair conformer. The chair conformation is estimated to be lower in energy than the twist conformation by approximately 23 kJ mol-1.

<p>I ran a few simple calculations molecular mechanics followed by DFT optimisation - gas phase on the axial and equatorial conformations which showed that the two conformations are separated by around 34 kcalmol. Besides boat conformation tends to convert into the boat-twist conformation. And now the stabilities. This too is almost free of angle strain but in contrast has torsional strain associated with eclipsed bonds at the four of the C atoms that form the side of the boat. The minimum energy conformation of your example is shown below. Chair conformation of cyclohexane is more stable than boat form because in chair conformaion the C-H bonds are equally axial and equatorial ie out of twelve C-H bonds six are axial and six are equatorial and each carbon has one axial and one equatorial C-H bond.

<p>Comparing 1 3 and 5 we see that 1 has two bad gauche interactions whereas 3 and 5 have only one gauche interaction. So the equatorial conformation is more stable than the axial by 728 kJmol. Chair conformation of cyclohexane is more stable than boat form because in chair conformaion the C-H bonds are equally axial and equatorial ie out of twelve C-H bonds six are axial and six are equatorial and each carbon has one axial and one equatorial C-H bond. A chair conformation is one of many conformations of a cyclohexane ring and it is most stable. The chair conformation that you have drawn 4 C 1 is likely to be the most stable one as it minimizes the number of heavy axial groupsTo determine the chair conformation of a hexose it is generally easiest to draw it and compare it with β-D-glucose where all heavy groups are equatorial and the conformation is 4 C 1If the number of heavy axial groups becomes smaller when the conformation. So the stability increases from Half chair to boat to twist boat and finally the chair conformation. Cyclohexane Chair Conformation Stability Which One Is Lower Energy.</p>

<p>For example the energy difference of the axial ethyl cyclohexane with the equatorial conformer is 73 kJmol. Firstly Newman projections along either of the horizontal C-C bonds in the boat form show eclipsing and secondly the two hydrogens shown the socalled bowsprit hydrogens come within such a short distance of one another that a repulsive force. Answer 1 of 3. The different conformations are called conformers a blend of the words conformation and isomer. For example the energy difference of the axial ethyl cyclohexane with the equatorial conformer is 73 kJmol. At 25 C 9999 of all molecules in a cyclohexane solution adopt this conformation.

<p>This too is almost free of angle strain but in contrast has torsional strain associated with eclipsed bonds at the four of the C atoms that form the side of the boat. A second much less stable conformer is the boat conformation. Why is chair conformation of cyclohexane more stable than boat form. Chair conformation of cyclohexane each carbon atom has one axial and one equatorial hydrogen atom correctly describes the the bond angles are near 1095 correctly describes the. The minimum energy conformation of your example is shown below. Just so you guys know 23 kilojoules per mole is a large number in.
