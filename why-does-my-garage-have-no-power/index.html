After checking and double checking all the wiring to the garage it all seems fine and I am getting 237-242v readings but still nothing is working in my garage. It can usually be found in the garage basement outside wall of the house and in older homes sometimes it will be located in a bathroom. We have power in our house but no power in our detached garage.

If your garage is detached or separate from the house it is possible that there is a loose wiring connection problem or a break in the line coming from the main building. We have power in our house but no power in our detached garage. If this does not restore power to the receptacles the problem may be a GFCI type receptacle has tripped and needs to be reset.
