<p>Straight bar dips work the chest incredibly well parallel bar dips work the chest also but tend to focus on the lower part. The bodyweight of men entering push ups lifts on Strength Level is on average heavier than those entering bench dips lifts. Dips at home Should I Do Weighted Dips. The main difference between these two exercises is what muscle group is put under tension. Larger range of motion and they carry over very well to push-ups.

<p>You will also build massive shoulders triceps and upper chest in the process. In my opinion push-ups are a much more natural movement than dips. Push-ups are a staple exercise for a reason. Push-ups put more pressure on the deltoids and the pecs while dips put more pressure on the triceps. Thus weighted push ups and dips move the chest through a greater range of motion than the bench press. Full bodyweight dips are awesome if you keep adding weight with a belt.
