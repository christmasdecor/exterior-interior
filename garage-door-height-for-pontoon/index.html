Tilted the steering wheel down and captains seat.</p>
<h3 id="if-your-boat-is-above-a-certain-height-you-need-a-permit-to-tow-it">If your boat is above a certain height you need a permit to tow it.</h3><p>Clearly the trailer will still be one foot outside at the bay door if parked straight in. 10x10 door and 27 deep is what I would do. 12 feet would be pushing it but probably would be doable Im thinking.
