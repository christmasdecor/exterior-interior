<p>Meaning that for a room with a ceiling height of eight feet the chair rail would be no higher than 32 inches from the floor. Therefore if you have shorter chairs a shorter chair rail.

<p>Not all ceilings are 8 feet high. Correct Height for Chair Rail Molding. However the baseboard is a whopping 11 high and the chair rail. However there are many factors to take into account such as how high your ceilings are and how tall you want the room to feel and what is the primary purpose of installing the rail. We have 12 foot ceilings in a 100 year old home and they placed the rail at 3 foot which is actually 14 of the room height.

<p>Hull cautions that most people install chair rails too high on their walls. To get that approximate chair rail height measure the ceiling height in inches and divide that number by three. I told my builder I wanted it hung at 34 - I meant the bottom of the rail would be at 34. Ill put dark red on the lower walls medium taupe on upper walls light taupe on all trims and an even lighter version of taupe on the ceiling and doors. For instance an 8-foot ceiling will have a chair rail at 32 inches from the floor. So in an eight-foot-tall room youd want to hang your chair rail moulding at around 32 inches from the ground.
