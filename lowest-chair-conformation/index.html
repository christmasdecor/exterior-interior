<p>In this conformation there is no torsional strain at all and as we shall see later no strain of any kind. To determine the chair conformation of a hexose it is generally easiest to draw it and compare it with β-D-glucose where all heavy groups are equatorial and the conformation is 4 C 1. This is the chair conformation. The depiction below on the left has the red-colored hydrogen atoms in what is termed axial conformation. If the number of heavy axial groups becomes smaller when the conformation is changed to 1 C 4 all equatorial groups in 4 C 1 become axial and vice versa then it is likely that the conformation is 1 C 4.

<p>Draw the second chair conformation ring-flip-check this post if not sure. There are two possibilities that are cis or trans but the position of the methyl group on axial or equatorial bond on cyclohexane determines whether the compound is cis or trans. The chair conformation has alternating axial up axial down so once you have that single axial substituent move on to. And models will always be permitted in examinations. In a chair conformation with a few exceptions only axial substituents will give rise to steric strain energy. D The higher energy chair conformation contains two axial methyl groups.

<p>As we have discussed earlier the chair conformation of cyclohexane is the most stable because it has the lowest strain energy. For cis-13-dimethylcyclohexane the lowest energy chair conformation implies that the methyl groups of 1 and 3 carbons of the cyclohexane ring must occupy the equatorial positions. In this conformation there is no torsional strain at all and as we shall see later no strain of any kind. Identify the up tip OR down tip of your chair conformation and draw a straight line up up tip or down down tip parallel to the y-plane.
